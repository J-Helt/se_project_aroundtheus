## Around the U.S. Project

Updates-

- Altered text on **README.md** file.
- Made several changes to files in **blocks** folder.
- Altered **index.html** file.

Description-

    This is a project created to grow my understanding of html and css codes. Flexbox and Grid display was used to arrange items in the project. Hover semantic tags were used on all buttons in the project to create a more user friendly experience, highlighting them when they are hovered over.

Images-
